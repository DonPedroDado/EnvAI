## What is EnvAI?
EnvAI is an intelligent environmental monitoring device that continuously collects data, performs advanced analysis to identify anomalies, and provides detailed insights to the user. It is designed for **small to medium-sized environments**, offering real-time awareness and actionable intelligence.

> ⚠️ Important Notice:  
> EnvAI is optimized for smaller spaces due to its lightweight hardware and software specifications. Deployment in large-scale buildings may require additional infrastructure. For guidance, please open an issue on our repository.

## Hardware Features

### CO₂ Detector
Monitors carbon dioxide levels to ensure safety, especially in kitchens or enclosed rooms. CO₂ detectors are standard safety measures in many countries, including Germany.

### Humidity Sensor
Tracks humidity trends for environmental control, aiding operations like humidifier management or data collection for research purposes.

### Temperature Sensor
Provides continuous ambient temperature monitoring to maintain comfort or detect unusual fluctuations.

### Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detector
CO is colorless and odorless, binding to hemoglobin about **200× faster than oxygen**, causing potential cellular oxygen deprivation. Detects gas leaks from appliances, garages, or ventilation systems.

### Radon (Rn) Detector
Monitors radon gas, a naturally occurring radioactive element. Long-term exposure can increase lung health risks, particularly in basements with uranium-rich soil.

### Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) Detector
Identifies respiratory irritants from indoor and outdoor sources, including stoves, fireplaces, and tobacco smoke.

### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Detector
Detects harmful chemicals like formaldehyde, benzene, and toluene from paints, plastics, or cleaning products, some of which may be carcinogenic or flammable.

### Methane (CH₄) & Propane (C₃H₈) Detector
Detects flammable gases that can displace oxygen or pose explosion hazards. Useful for monitoring gas leaks in homes or garages.

### Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S) Detector
Monitors toxic gases produced by sewage, stagnant water, or decaying organic matter. Even low concentrations can impair smell detection and safety.
