## What is EnvAI?  
EnvAI is a device designed to monitor environmental conditions within a specified space. It gathers relevant data, performs analysis to identify irregularities or anomalies, and provides comprehensive reports to the user.

> ⚠️ **Note:** EnvAI is designed for small to medium-sized spaces. Its lightweight hardware and software are **not recommended for large buildings**. If you wish to use EnvAI in larger facilities, please contact [donpietro.dado@gmail.com](mailto:donpietro.dado@gmail.com) for guidance and support.

## Hardware Features

### CO₂ Detector  
This is one of the most important functionalities of EnvAI, especially in environments like kitchens or rooms where CO₂ accumulation may pose safety risks. In Germany and many other countries, CO₂ detectors are standard safety measures to ensure a secure environment.

### Humidity Sensor  
Provides valuable insights regarding the designated space, such as monitoring humidity levels for operating humidifiers or collecting environmental data.

### Temperature Sensor  
Essential for effectively monitoring ambient temperature within your home or workspace.

### Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detector  
Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, making detection difficult. It binds to hemoglobin about **200 times more efficiently than oxygen**, potentially causing cellular oxygen deprivation. Common sources include gas appliances, vehicles in attached garages, and malfunctioning heating or ventilation systems.

### Radon (Rn) Detector  
Radon is a radioactive noble gas. Prolonged exposure may increase the risk of lung issues, including cancer. It naturally migrates through soil and basements, especially in granite or uranium-rich areas.

### Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) Detector  
Exposure can cause respiratory irritation, worsen asthma, and potentially reduce lung function. Sources include gas stoves, wood-burning appliances, tobacco smoke, and outdoor air pollution infiltration.

### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Detector  
Compounds such as formaldehyde, benzene, and toluene can be carcinogenic or neurotoxic. Long-term exposure poses health risks, and some are flammable. Sources include paints, cleaning products, new furniture, plastics, and air fresheners.

### Methane (CH₄) and Propane (C₃H₈) Detector  
Highly flammable gases that pose explosion and asphyxiation risks. Methane can displace oxygen in enclosed spaces. Common sources include gas leaks from appliances and poorly ventilated basements near aging pipelines.

### Hydrogen Sulfide (H₂S) Detector  
Hazardous even at minimal concentrations; elevated levels can impair smell detection. Common sources include sewage systems, stagnant water, and decomposing organic material.
